# Unet_Application_to_Saturn_Kilometric_Radiation

Python scripts that used in paper that is currently in prep. titled 'Image-based classification of intense radio bursts from1 spectrograms: An application to Saturn Kilometric Radiation'. In this paper we describe how we train a modified U-net architecture for semantic segmentation of Low Frequency Extensions (LFEs) of Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR) detected by Cassini/RPWS. We train the model using a catalogue found at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7895766).

The configurations file must be updated to users own configuration, it has 3 filepaths. 'input_data' (where the data needed to run the scripts are stored), 'output_data' (where the data generated by the scripts is stored) and then 'model_name' (the name of the folder where the model weights are stored). 

## 'input_data' should have the following files:
### LFE files for training:
  'SKR_LFEs.json'\
  'total_timestamps.csv'
### radio data:
  'SKR_2004_CJ.sav'\
  ...\
  'SKR_2017_001-258_CJ.sav'
### Trajectory data: 
  '2004_FGM_KRTP_1M.TAB'\
  ...\
  '2017_FGM_KRTP_1M.TAB'\
  '2004_FGM_KSM_1M.TAB'\
  ...\
  '2017_FGM_KSM_1M.TAB'
